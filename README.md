# Project Omoikane
Named after the Shinto god of wisdom and intelligence, Project Omoikane will serve as my personal website. It will be based off the microservice architecture. All work within this repo has been written by me. 

## Gateway Service
The gateway service will serve as the entry point for users. This service was built off Spring Boot, Netflix Zuul and Eureka web technologies.

## Resume Service
The resume service will provide the user with RESTFUL operations for my resume. This service was developed on Spring Boot.
