# Project Omoikane
Named after the Shinto god of wisdom and intelligence, Project Omoikane will serve as my personal website. It will be based off the microservice architecture.

## Gateway Service
The gateway service will serve as the entry point for users. This service was built off Spring Boot, Netflix Zuul and Eureka web technologies.
